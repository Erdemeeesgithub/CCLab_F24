        I can’t believe how people in the past treated the Earth, like it was
        some endless supply of resources to waste and destroy. They ignored all
        the warnings, trashed the oceans, burned through energy, and didn’t care
        about the future. Now we’re stuck cleaning up their mess—why couldn’t
        they have just thought ahead?

        You think you're angry about the past, but your kind destroyed the
        Earth. You had the chance to fix it, but you let the same mistakes
        happen. Now you want to change what's already ruined—it's your fault
        too. Go back, fix it, or there won't be a future left!
