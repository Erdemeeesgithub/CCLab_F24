        <h2>Rhino</h2>
        <p>
          By 1970, rhino numbers dropped to 70,000, and today, around 27,000
          rhinos remain in the wild. Very few rhinos survive outside national
          parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over
          many decades. Three species of rhino—black, Javan, and Sumatran—are
          critically endangered .

        <p>
          The Black Kokanee, also known as the Kunimasu, is a rare freshwater
          fish, once native to Lake Tazawa in Japan. This species, a variant of
          the sockeye salmon, is distinguished by its smaller size, typically
          measuring about 20 cm / 8 inches in length.

          Captain Cook's Bean Snail is a small snail species that was once found
          on the islands Raiatea and Tahaa, both part of the Society Islands
          archipelago. The snail was collected on one of explorer Captain James
          Cook’s famous voyages and subsequently named by zoologist Thomas
          Martyn.

          Père David's Deer is a large deer species native to river valleys and

        <h2>Gobi Bear</h2>
        <p>
          The Gobi bear is a unique species of brown bear living exclusively in
          the Mongolian Gobi Desert. The cute but scraggly-looking bear, also
          known to the Mongolians as “Mazaalai”, is critically endangered, with
          less than 40 individuals left in the wild. Feeding on wild rhubarb,
          berries, nitre bush, grass shoots, wild onion, and other plants
          supported by desert springs, the Gobi bears have a unique diet.
          Changing climate and overgrazing livestock make it increasingly
          difficult for these wandering bears to find food.

        <h2>Angels’s trumpets (Brugmansia species)</h2>
        <p>
          The glorious large trumpet flowers of Brugmansia have ensured that it
          is a favourite plant in botanic gardens. The seven wild species of
          Brugmansia were native to South America but are all now only found in
          gardens. The absence of wild Brugmansia plants was first recorded in
          the late 18th Century. It’s likely that their decline was largely a
          result of the extinction of the unknown animal that dispersed their
          seeds.

        <p>
          The rare pygmy Rwandan waterlily is the smallest waterlily in the
          world. In 2008, it was thought to be Extinct in the Wild. Kew ‘s
          horticulturists have since successfully propagated new plants, and two
          previously unknown wild populations were recorded in Rwanda in 2023
          and 2024.
