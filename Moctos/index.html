          <p>
            Moctosâ€™s father was a snake and his mother was an octopus. Moctos
            struggled to fit in with the other creatures in his swamp because of
            his unique features. Neither octopus nor snake accepted him so that
            led him to hide in the swamp more.

          Moctos, an octopus-like monster that lives in the swamp surrounded by
          luminous beetles. He loves bubbles and you will find bubbles all
          around the swamp. He would spend his free time chasing bubbles around
          the swamp. His mother taught him how to create bubbles using his ink
          when he was younger. To this day he still finds it fun and it brings
          him a lot of joy. If you click one, he will happily pop it for you.But
          be careful! Moctos hates birds. Moctos was once an outgoing and
          curious young creature who loved exploring. Then one day he approached
          a predatory bird's nest too close while exploring and one of the birds
          blinded him in one eye. Since then he lived with his fear and hatred
          of birds. This resulted not only in a change in his personality but
          also led him to develop ink-shooting skills to keep himself safe. So
          if you press on the bird he will react by shooting ink everywhere
          which makes your screen black.

            >Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span
          >
          You are a scientist(Loa Kivin) who is watching the viral tiktok video
          which was taken by the teenagers. If you press on the bubbles, moctos
          will go to the bubble and pop it for you. But if you press on the
          bird, he will shoot ink everywhere to protect himself(he is scared of
          birds) which will make your phone screen go black.
